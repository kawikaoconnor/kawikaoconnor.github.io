During the summer of 2022, I participated in an REU focused on group theory. The following poster was the result of a summer of research into a particular problem in group theory.

The REU was funded in part by the NSF and the NSA, and took place at Texas State University in San Marcos.

The problem presented to our group during the REU was to attempt to bound the number of -- what are termed -- almost p-regular conjugacy classes of a finite group from below, where the prime p divides the order of the group.

The specific bound we were reaching for was ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?2%5Csqrt%7Bp-%201%7D).

Some explanation for the term "almost p-regular" is required.

An element g of a group G is termed "almost p-regular" if the order of g is either co-prime to p, or if the order of g was divisible by one, and exactly one copy of p. Conjugacy classes are deemed to be almost p-regular if every element in said conjugacy class is almost p-regular, as order is constant in a conjugacy class. Significant work and progress had been made by previous researchers focusing on the broader question of bounding the number of p-element, and p'-element conjugacy classes -- those classes whose elements are either p-elements or p'-elements. Unfortunately, introducing elements whose order was divisible by p and by something else, made a key step in certain inductive arguments to break down.

Ultimately, the following poster is the culmination of the summer, laying out the groundwork for a potential proof of the statement. It should be noted, that work is still ongoing though, and some of the details are now out-dated.

The poster can be found [here](https://github.com/kawikaoconnor/kawikaoconnor.github.io/blob/main/projects/On_conjugacy_classes_of_varying_p_regularity_level__Poster_.pdf).
