 <p>In the 2017-18 academic year, I recieved the YES-Abroad scholarship, which sent me to live in West-Africa for ten months, specifically in Ghana. The scholarship – funded by the State Department – requires all the participants to complete the year by doing some project. It can be of any size, of any scope of ambition, and on any topic. Some students decide to make cookbooks of local recipies, some will learn to tailor in local styles, others will reserach and write an essay on some local topic.</p>

<p>I wanted to try my clumsy hand at ethnographic research.</p>

<p>The northern part of Ghana is considerably drier, and less developed than the south. Ghana as a modern country boasts as being the home to roughly 80 languages, where more than 50 of said languages are found in the northern regions of Ghana. While the south is predominantly Christian – albeit, a distinctly different flavour of Christian than what is found in many Western nations – the north of Ghana is majority Muslim, with a higher percentage of people practicing traditional beliefs as well.</p>

<p>While at the time I had lived for 9 months in the south of Ghana, it became starkly clear from these facts that the north of Ghana was culturally distinct from the culture that I had now gained some familiarty with. I wanted to learn more from the northern regions of Ghana.</p>

<p>My proposal was to travel in the north for two weeks, visiting various villages and asking chiefs and village storytellers if they would share stories with me. A friend of mine brought along a voice recorder, so that I could later go through and roughly “transcribe” the stories. I but the word “transcribe” in quotes, since the document didn’t end up being a true transcription, more of a re-telling of the same stories. I tried to keep the re-telling as close to the same narrative as possible though.</p>

<p>A link to the document in it’s total can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/kawikaoconnor/kawikaoconnor.github.io/blob/main/Capstone%20Stories%20of%20the%20North.pdf">here</a>.</p>
