  <h1 class="display-4">On the Number of Conjugacy Classes of Almost p-regular Elements in Finite Groups</h1>
 <p>During the summer of 2022, I participated in an REU focused on group theory. The following poster was the result of a summer of research into a particular problem in group theory.</p>

<p>The REU was funded in part by the NSF and the NSA, and took place at Texas State University in San Marcos.</p>

<p>The problem presented to our group during the REU was to attempt to bound the number of – what are termed – almost p-regular conjugacy classes of a finite group from below, where the prime p divides the order of the group.</p>

<p>The specific bound we were reaching for was <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?2%5Csqrt%7Bp-%201%7D" alt="equation" />.</p>

<p>Some explanation for the term “almost p-regular” is required.</p>

<p>An element g of a group G is termed “almost p-regular” if the order of g is either co-prime to p, or if the order of g was divisible by one, and exactly one copy of p. Conjugacy classes are deemed to be almost p-regular if every element in said conjugacy class is almost p-regular, as order is constant in a conjugacy class. Significant work and progress had been made by previous researchers focusing on the broader question of bounding the number of p-element, and p’-element conjugacy classes – those classes whose elements are either p-elements or p’-elements. Unfortunately, introducing elements whose order was divisible by p and by something else, made a key step in certain inductive arguments to break down.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the following poster is the culmination of the summer, laying out the groundwork for a potential proof of the statement. It should be noted, that work is still ongoing though, and some of the details are now out-dated.</p>

<p>The poster can be found <a href="https://github.com/kawikaoconnor/kawikaoconnor.github.io/blob/main/projects/On_conjugacy_classes_of_varying_p_regularity_level__Poster_.pdf">here</a>.</p>
